# DuRoom CLI

The DuRoom development ecosystem is oriented around many small, modules, interacting extensions.
This is a very powerful and flexible paradigm, but it also brings the maintenance cost of creating and maintaining all these extensions.

We've created the DuRoom CLI (command line interface) as a tool to help developers by automating some repetitive and menial tasks, and allow them to get into the actual work without much hassle.

See the [package's readme](https://github.com/DuRoom/cli#readme) for information on:

- Installation
- Usage
- Upgrading
- Available commands
- Some implementation details, if you're interested
