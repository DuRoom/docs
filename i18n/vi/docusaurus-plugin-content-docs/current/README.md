# Về DuRoom

DuRoom is a delightfully simple discussion platform for your website. It's fast, free, and easy to use, with all the features you need to run a successful community. It's also extremely extensible, allowing for ultimate customizability.

## Mục tiêu

DuRoom is the combined successor of [esoTalk](https://github.com/esotalk/esoTalk) and [FluxBB](https://fluxbb.org). It is designed to be:

* **Fast and simple.** No clutter, no bloat, no complex dependencies. DuRoom is built with PHP so it’s quick and easy to deploy. The interface is powered by [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org), a performant JavaScript framework with a tiny footprint.

* **Beautiful and responsive.** This is forum software for humans. DuRoom is carefully designed to be consistent and intuitive across platforms, out-of-the-box.

* **Powerful and extensible.** Customize, extend, and integrate DuRoom to suit your community. DuRoom architecture is amazingly flexible, with a [powerful Extension API](/extend/README.md).

* **Miễn phí và mở.** DuRoom được phát hành theo [giấy phép MIT](https://github.com/DuRoom/duroom/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Trợ giúp dự án DuRoom

DuRoom is [free, open source](https://github.com/DuRoom/core) software, maintained and governed by volunteers. We rely on community contributions to help us improve and expand DuRoom.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Join [our community](https://discuss-duroom.js.org) to talk about DuRoom development, get help with your instance, or just meet cool people! If you're experienced with DuRoom, you can also help out beginners!

🐛 If there's a bug that's bothering you, or a feature idea on your mind, we can't know about it unless you tell us! We track bugs, suggestions, and future development plans [via GitHub issues](https://github.com/DuRoom/core/issues). If there's already an issue open, adding likes and (constructive) additional information can be very helpful!

📣 And if you like DuRoom, please consider blogging/tweeting/talking about it! More people aware of DuRoom leads to more people engaging with DuRoom, and therefore more activity, better extensions, and faster development.

DuRoom wouldn't be possible without our phenomenal community. If you're interested in contributing, see our [developer contribution](contributing.md) and [other contribution](contributing-docs-translations.md) docs for more information.
